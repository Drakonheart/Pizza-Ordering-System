# Pizza-Ordering-System
The 'order.py' file manages pizza orders interactively, allowing users to customize their pizzas by size and toppings. It prompts for pizza specifications, offers a topping list, and generates a receipt displaying ordered pizzas with respective costs, total tax, and the final order price, enhancing the pizza ordering experience.
